# Chapter 12.2: Changing Your Bitcoin Hidden Services

In this chapter we will show you how to create or change your local Bitcoin Hidden Service.   To archieve this we need to add current user to tor or debian-tor group to guarantee that Bitcoin daemon can sets up an automatic hidden service on the first startup if it's correclty configured.    Bitcoind will create a file called onion_private_key in the data directory.  Further check if file control.authcookie exists like this:

```
~$ ll /run/tor/control.authcookie
-rw-r----- 1 debian-tor debian-tor 32 jun 26 09:44 /run/tor/control.authcookie
```

To avoid see a message like this in debug log file you need to add your current user to debian-tor group like this:

debug.log

```
2020-05-15T16:49:20Z tor: Authentication cookie /run/tor/control.authcookie could not be opened (check permissions)
```

```
~$ sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor [CHANGE_MY_USER]
```

If you're running a older version Tor like 0.2.7 add this lines to /etc/tor/torrc file:

```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/
HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333
HiddenServicePort 18333 127.0.0.1:18333
```
If you're running Tor version 3 bitcoind will configurate hidden services automatically to listen on.
