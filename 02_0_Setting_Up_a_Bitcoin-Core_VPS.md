## Objectives for this Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Decide Between the Five Major Types of Bitcoin Nodes
   * Create a Bitcoin Node for Development
   * Create a Local Instance of the Bitcoin Blockchain

Supporting objectives include the ability to:

   * Understand the Basic Network Setup of the VPS
   * Decide Which Security Priorities to Implement
   * Understand the Difference between Pruned and Unpruned Nodes

You don't actually need to read this entire chapter. Decide if you want to set up your VPS by hand, typing in every command (ยง2.1); if you want to run a StackScript to set it up on a Linode VPS (ยง2.2); or you want to set up on a different environment, such as on an AWS machine or a Mac (ยง2.3). Then, jump to the appropriate section.
