# Chapter Eighteen: Understanding Your Lighting Setup

> :information_source: **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

In this chapter you'll be ready to begin working with the `lightning-cli` command-line interface. But that first requires that you understand your c-lightning setup and its features, which is what will be explained with some examples and basic configuration.

For this and future chapters, we presume that you have a VPS with c-lightning installed, running `lightningd` courtersy of [Bitcoin Standup Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts).
We also presume that you are connected to testnet, allowing for access to bitcoins without using real funds. You can either do this by hand, per [ยง2.1: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS by Hand](02_1_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_by_Hand.md), with Bitcoin Standup at Linode.com, per [ยง2.2: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with Bitcoin Standup](02_2_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.md), or via other means, per [ยง2.3: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core Machine via Other Means](02_3_Setting_Up_Bitcoin_Core_Other.md).
