# A2.0: Setting Up a Bitcoin Regtest 

While developing Bitcoin applications, you might want to use your applications isolated from any public Blockchain such as the Mainnet or the Testnet.
You can create a Blockchain from scratch using the Regtest, with one main advantage over Testnet: you choose when to create new blocks, so you have complete control over the environment.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Create your own Blockchain from scratch
   * Generate/mine blocks and get the rewards
   * Get balance and interact with Bitcoind in a private way
